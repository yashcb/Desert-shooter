# Desert-shooter ðŸ”«

I created this project on my learning journey. I wanted to give it feel of a top-down shooter movement and animations.
AI is basic and has 2 types : 
- Steady
- Patrolling

Player can kill, avoid and be killed by enemy, Player can also go to next map and come back.
Many things can be added on top, will add new changes in future.

Here are some captures that depicts player and enemy AI at struggle
